  Forest

# Overview

You play as a ghost in a dark, murky forest. Your goal is to survive, explore, and capture territory to gain resources, craft artifacts and become a lord of a castle. But be careful, the more territory you gain, the harder it is to protect! To achieve substantial results, you'll need to join a guild

But guilds aren't the only political power in the Murky Forest. Remember, each race has its own distinct power and sphere of influence



### Planned Features&#x20;

* `RvR` (race versus race) system. Each ghost race has its own in-round distinct role and ability &#x20;
* Real-time `on-chain PvP` (aim 100+ players at first)&#x20;
* Guilds system&#x20;
* `Capture the territory` to earn resources during the round&#x20;
* `Castles` serve as non-combat zones for resource trading and artifact crafting. Castle owners collect the trading fees and participate in global economical game&#x20;
* two types of game assets: permanent (aavegotchi characters, items, alchemica) and in-round (artifacts, resources)&#x20;



The game is built on top of assets from [aavegothi.com](https://aavegothi.com) assets, using the [mud.dev](https://mud.dev/) framework
