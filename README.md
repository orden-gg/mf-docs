  Murky Forest is an on-chain, survival, mass PvP, RvR RTS, inspired by Dark
  Forest
---

# Overview

You play as a ghost in a dark, murky forest. Your goal is to survive, explore, and capture territory to gain resources, craft artifacts and become a lord of a castle. But be careful, the more territory you gain, the harder it is to protect! To achieve substantial results, you'll need to join a guild

### Planned Features&#x20;

* Trustless sync wrapper for aavegotchi assets
* Round based system
* Real-time `on-chain PvP` (aim 100+ players at first)&#x20;
* Guilds system&#x20;
* Guilds system (integrating fireball on-chain guilds)
* `Capture the territory` to earn resources during the round&#x20;
* `Castles` serve as non-combat zones for resource trading and artifact crafting. Castle owners collect the trading fees and participate in global economical game&#x20;
* two types of game assets: permanent (aavegotchi characters, items, alchemica) and in-round (artifacts, resources)&#x20;
* ~~redacted~~ Alchemica and GLTR use case&#x20;

The game is built on top of assets from [aavegothi.com](https://aavegothi.com) assets, using the [mud.dev](https://mud.dev/) framework
