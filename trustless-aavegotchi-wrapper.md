# Trustless AAvegotchi Wrapper

A system is responsible for parsing and storing the state of Aavegotchi assets inside a murky forest database.

This system is used for the following purposes:

1. To sync the exact state and stats of Aavegotchi characters, items, and tokens. This structure can be reused by many different games.
2. To use the capabilities of the [MUD2 framework](https://mud.dev/) to build experimental on-chain layers for both, aavegotchi and murky forest protocols
